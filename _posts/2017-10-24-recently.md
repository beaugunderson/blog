I really enjoy [@tmcw](https://twitter.com/tmcw)'s ["recently" posts][recently]
posts so I'm stealing the format for myself. Since this is my first "recently"
I'll talk about the last year or so and shoot to write a new post once a month
from here on.

### Emmylou (the boat)

We had Emmylou out of the water for the summer for blister repair and a new
propeller (as well as various other projects, including lots of varnish
removal).

We've started to oil the bare teak but it's slow going due to the rainy
weather.

This will be our second winter aboard, I think we'll have a better handle on
the condensation this year (we'll use two dehumidifiers and an oil radiator
heater this year).

### Creative projects

I have some ideas for [@lindenmoji](https://twitter.com/lindenmoji) that I've
attempted and failed to implement a few times, mostly around adding commands
that would allow drawing hypotrochoids (also known as spirographs). I'd also
like to change how @lindenmoji randomly generates its systems by moving most of
the generation to each sub-command.

I made [@everyblockchain](https://twitter.com/everyblockchain), a terrible bot
that replaces nouns in the WordNet sentence examples corpus with "blockchain".

### Music

I found [Warehouse][warehouse], [American Wolf][wolf], and
[Yucky Duster][duster].

I've been been digging the new CHON, Angel Vivaldi and Prom Queen albums.

For a full recounting you can [see me on last.fm][lastfm].

### Day job

At [Canvas][canvas] I built out our e-prescribing service which entailed
lots of XML parsing and generation (via PyXB). I then switched to our front-end
and implemented messaging, which required me to first learn React. I was
excited about the React license change.

### Vim

I switched from othree/javascript to pangloss/javascript. I also switched from
neomake to ALE. Both changes resulted in a faster-feeling editor.

### Giving

Since January 1st I gave people money directly over the Internet ~148 times (or
about once every two days):

- 1 via ko-fi.com
- 1 via Venmo
- 27 via YouCaring
- 29 via PayPal
- 39 via GoFundMe
- 51 via Square Cash

Approximately 5% received money more than once, meaning ~139 people received
money. The majority of people who received money are trans (due in large part
to who I follow on Twitter and my own views about who is vulnerable due to the
current political situation in the US).

I'm still donating monthly to [Fund Club][fund-club],
[Double Union][double-union], and [Donors Choose][donors-choose] (specifically
to classrooms that want copies of Sherman Alexie's books). I recently added
[Vocal Minority][vm] to the monthly list as well.

Finally, I am [raising money for my good friend sui on YouCaring][sui]. We
would appreciate it if you're able to contribute!
